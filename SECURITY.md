## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Data Protection

**Model Files:**
- Never include pre-trained models with sensitive or proprietary data
- Validate all model inputs to prevent adversarial attacks
- Use secure channels when downloading or sharing model files

**Training Data:**
- Ensure training data doesn't contain sensitive personal information
- Implement proper data anonymization techniques
- Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations when applicable

**Configuration Files:**
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

### Code Security

**Input Validation:**
```python
# Good: Validate image inputs
def validate_image(image_path: str) -> bool:
    if not os.path.exists(image_path):
        return False
    try:
        with Image.open(image_path) as img:
            img.verify()
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False

# Bad: No validation
def process_image(image_path: str):
    img = Image.open(image_path)  # Potential security risk
```

**File Handling:**
```python
# Good: Secure file operations
import os
from pathlib import Path

def save_model(model, filename: str, base_dir: str = "models"):
    # Prevent directory traversal
    safe_path = Path(base_dir) / Path(filename).name
    if not safe_path.resolve().is_relative_to(Path(base_dir).resolve()):
        raise ValueError("Invalid file path")
    
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), safe_path)

# Bad: Vulnerable to directory traversal
def save_model_unsafe(model, filename: str):
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), filename)  # Dangerous!
```

**Model Loading:**
```python
# Good: Safe model loading
def load_model_safe(model_path: str):
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("Model file not found")
    
    # Load with restricted pickle protocols
    return torch.load(model_path, map_location='cpu', weights_only=True)

# Bad: Unsafe pickle loading
def load_model_unsafe(model_path: str):
    return torch.load(model_path)  # Pickle vulnerability
```

### Infrastructure Security

**Docker Security:**
- Use official base images from trusted sources
- Regularly update base images to patch vulnerabilities
- Run containers with non-root users
- Implement proper resource limits

**Dependencies:**
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `safety`, `bandit`)
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
- Audit third-party packages before use

### Privacy Considerations

**Face Recognition (Task B):**
- Implement privacy-preserving techniques where possible
- Provide options for data anonymization
- Follow biometric data protection regulations
- Consider differential privacy for training data

**Gender Classification (Task A):**
- Be aware of bias and fairness implications
- Implement bias detection and mitigation
- Provide transparency about model limitations
- Consider ethical implications of deployment

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

### Model Security
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial examples
- **Model Inversion**: Potential information leakage about training data
- **Membership Inference**: Possibility of determining if data was used in training

### Data Security
- **Training Data**: Models may memorize and leak training data
- **Biometric Data**: Face recognition involves sensitive biometric information
- **Class Imbalance**: May lead to biased or unfair outcomes

## üîç Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning tools:

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety semgrep

# Run security scans
bandit -r Task_A/ Task_B/
safety check
semgrep --config=auto Task_A/ Task_B/
```

### Continuous Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning on every commit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security assessments

## üîê Secure Development Guidelines

### Code Review
- All code changes require security review
- Focus on input validation and sanitization
- Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Verify proper error handling

### Testing
- Include security test cases
- Test with malformed inputs
- Validate against common attack vectors
- Performance testing under load

### Deployment
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Log security events for monitoring
- Regular security updates and patches
